## Particles Effect with Metaballs (In Progress)

# Objective
When users click on the screen it will add a particle (ball) to the system (box). 
If you hold down the click longer, the particle will be larger.
Middle mouse scroll to make them move faster?
The idea is that users can keep adding particles indefinitely. The particles will move at random velocity (direction)
and collide with the wall (but not with each other). We will also add in the metaballs effect such that when the 
particles collide with each other, it looks nicer.

# Features:
- WebGL Implementation
- Pixel Shader Simulation
- Collision Detection with Bounding Box
- Metaballs using Ray Casting
- Diffuse + Spectular Lighting
- (Maybe) Soft Shadow?
